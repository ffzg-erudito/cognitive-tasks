## STROOP TASK

This script implements a Stroop task, containing 20 practice trials and 100 experimental trials, following a mixed (as 
opposed to a blocked) design, wherein 4 conditions - 2 (target congruence) x 2 (answer congruence) - are sequentially 
presented to the participant in a random fashion. 

Participants are to identify the COLOUR of the upper target word by selecting one of the alternatives according to its MEANING.
For example, if the target word is the word "GREEN" written in RED COLOUR, the participant should select the word "RED",
regardless of its colour (i.e. it could very well be written in green colour).

The participant either responds with the left and right arrow keys (stroop_arrows.m) or the left and right CTRL (stroop_ctrl.m)

## TO-DO: consider implementing a fail-safe warning mechanism if participants respond too slowly
